Tasks to be Accomplished
Task 1. Write a class named Sorting that will implement the following sorting algorithms.
a. Bubble Sort
b. Selection Sort
c. Merge Sort
d. Quick Sort
Note: You have to write a test function that will do the following tasks:
● Randomly generate 1,000,000 integers and record the running time of
each function for sorting the integers.
● Generate 1,000,000 sorted integers (in increasing order) and record the
running time of each function for sorting the integers.
● Generate 1,000,000 sorted integers (in decreasing order) and record the
running time of each function for sorting the integers.
The algorithms should sort the given integers in increasing order.
Task 2. Write a class named Searching that will implement the following searching
algorithms. 
a. Linear Search
b. Binary Search
Task 3. Elevator System: Build a program that simulates the operation of an elevator
system in a multi-story building. Use a queue or a priority queue to handle
elevator requests from different floors and efficiently manage the movement of
elevators.
